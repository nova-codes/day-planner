## How it Works

-   Make a calendar to represent the workday: 8:00AM - 5:00PM.
-   The day is shown in hour time blocks.
-   Each time block is color coded to indicate whether it occurs in the past (grey), present (red) or future (green).
-   Each time block has an input field and ‘save’ buttons.
-   Appointments can be entered to a specific hour inline, and the ‘save’ button saves them to local storage.
-   This application uses  [jquery](https://jquery.com/)  and  [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)  , and  [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  .
